        abstract: "Content-centric networking is an architecture designed to transfer
named and addressable data from producers to consumers. Data retrieval is driven
by a simple request and response protocol. A consumer issues a request for
named data that is routed by the network towards the nearest location where
this data is stored. Once found, the corresponding data is returned to the
consumer. This data-centric model is different from the datagram- and
stream-based protocols used to transport data between endpoints in IP
networks: Instead of being tied to the channel through which data flows,
security and privacy properties apply to data itself.
Consequently, privacy issues in CCN warrant
careful evaluation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment of CCN
privacy issues in the presence of various adversaries.
We specify conditions sufficient to achieve different levels of privacy.
We also show that data privacy is more dependent on requests than
responses for data. We conclude that strong privacy necessitates
some form of session- or channel-based communication, which strongly contradicts
the data-centric nature of CCN. We also discuss how to implement proposed CCN
privacy mechanisms in practice."

        abstract: "Content-centric networking (CCN) is a networking paradigm that
emphasizes request-response-based data transfer. A {\em consumer}
issues a request explicitly referencing desired data by name. A {\em producer}
assigns a name to each data it publishes. Names are used both to identify data
to and route traffic between consumers and producers. The type, format, and representation
of names are fundamental to CCN. Currently, names are represented as human-readable
application-layer URIs. This has several important security and performance implications
for the network.

In this paper, we propose to transparently decouple application-layer names from
their network-layer counterparts. We demonstrate a mapping between the two
namespaces that can be deterministically computed by consumers and producers,
using application names formatted according to the standard CCN URI scheme. Meanwhile,
consumers and producers can continue to use application-layer names. We detail the
computation and mapping function requirements and discuss their
impact on consumers, producers, and routers. Finally, we
comprehensively analyze several mapping functions to show their
functional equivalence to standard application names and argue that
they address several issues that stem from propagating application names into
the network."
