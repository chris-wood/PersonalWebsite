        abstract: "Content-centric networking is an architecture designed to transfer
named and addressable data from producers to consumers. Data retrieval is driven
by a simple request and response protocol. A consumer issues a request for
named data that is routed by the network towards the nearest location where
this data is stored. Once found, the corresponding data is returned to the
consumer. This data-centric model is different from the datagram- and
stream-based protocols used to transport data between endpoints in IP
networks: Instead of being tied to the channel through which data flows,
security and privacy properties apply to data itself.
Consequently, privacy issues in CCN warrant
careful evaluation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment of CCN
privacy issues in the presence of various adversaries.
We specify conditions sufficient to achieve different levels of privacy.
We also show that data privacy is more dependent on requests than
responses for data. We conclude that strong privacy necessitates
some form of session- or channel-based communication, which strongly contradicts
the data-centric nature of CCN. We also discuss how to implement proposed CCN
privacy mechanisms in practice."

        abstract: "Content-centric networking (CCN) is a networking paradigm that
emphasizes request-response-based data transfer. A {\em consumer}
issues a request explicitly referencing desired data by name. A {\em producer}
assigns a name to each data it publishes. Names are used both to identify data
to and route traffic between consumers and producers. The type, format, and representation
of names are fundamental to CCN. Currently, names are represented as human-readable
application-layer URIs. This has several important security and performance implications
for the network.

In this paper, we propose to transparently decouple application-layer names from
their network-layer counterparts. We demonstrate a mapping between the two
namespaces that can be deterministically computed by consumers and producers,
using application names formatted according to the standard CCN URI scheme. Meanwhile,
consumers and producers can continue to use application-layer names. We detail the
computation and mapping function requirements and discuss their
impact on consumers, producers, and routers. Finally, we
comprehensively analyze several mapping functions to show their
functional equivalence to standard application names and argue that
they address several issues that stem from propagating application names into
the network."

integrity and authenticity. Our primary contribution is the synthesis
and unified treatment of four different and popular trust models. We show in
which operational aspects they vary and emphasize which parts of the verification
mechanics are invariant. The verifier logic is expressed in Prolog to show
its simplicity (abstracting away, e.g., procedural certification chain
verification steps) and to highlight subtle errors that can occur in the
use and enforcement of trust models. The details of an implementation of our
trust engine in the CCNx network stack are presented to demonstrate its
viability and general modularity. A simplistic interface
enables the trust engine to be easily ported to any ICN-style network software.
Finally, we demonstrate how application instantiations of various trust
models are natively supported by the trust engine to illustrate its flexibility."

content caching in routers. It enables routers to satisfy content requests
with in-network cached copies, thereby reducing
bandwidth utilization, decreasing congestion, and improving
overall content retrieval latency.

One major drawback of in-network caching is that content producers have no
knowledge about where their content is stored. This is problematic if a
producer wishes to delete its content. In this paper, we show how to address
this problem with a protocol called BEAD (Best-Effort Autonomous Deletion).
It performs content deletion via small and secure packets that resemble
current CCN messages.
We discuss several methods of routing BEAD packets from producers to caching
routers with varying levels of network overhead and efficacy. We assess
BEAD's performance via simulations and provide a detailed analysis of its properties."

address some key limitations of the current IP-based Internet. One of its main features

routers. Despite the benefits of improved bandwidth utilization and lower latency of
retrieving popular content, in-network caching inhibits producers
from collecting information about content that is requested and later
served from network caches. Such information is often needed for accounting and
popularity purposes.
In this paper, we address accounting in CCN by varying the degree of
consumer, router, and producer involvement. We also identify and analyze inherent
performance and security tradeoffs. We show that fine-grained accounting
is infeasible with router caches and without explicit application support. We
then recommend accounting strategies that entail a few simple requirements for CCN architectures.
Finally, we show, via experimental results, that network-layer CCN accounting is
viable and incurs low overhead for all parties involved.

        abstract: "Privacy problems that stem from a lack of truly anonymous communication in
today's Internet are exacerbated by growing evidence of large-scale network packet
interception and eavesdropping. Internet users have a limited set of
tools available at their disposal to enable better communication, including
Tor and new protocols such as tcpcrypt and DNS-over-TLS. Content-Centric Networking (CCN)
is an emerging (inter-)networking architecture with the goal of becoming an alternative
to the IP-based Internet. Such an architecture must at least have parity with IP
based solutions for anonymous communication. Thus, there is a clear demand for
a CCN analog to Tor and related protocols.
ANDANA (Anonymous Named Data Networking Application) was the
initial attempt to satisfy this demand for CCNs in the
context of the legacy Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture -- an instance
of CCN. However, its elementary design and hasty implementation led to
performance and usability issues that hinder practical use. In this paper,
we introduce AC3N - Anonymous Communication
for Content-Centric Networking, a substantially evolved and improved incarnation of
ANDANA. AC3N supports high-throughput and low-latency anonymous content
retrieval in modern CCNs, for both unidirectional and bidirectional settings.
We discuss the design, implementation, performance, and anonymity properties of AC3N.
Our experimental results indicate that AC3N incurs very low overhead while
providing anonymity features analogous to Tor."

Many modern block ciphers are based on the substitution permutation network (SPN) design. The substitution step is commonly the only non-linear transformation in the cipher, and is usually comprised of a permutation which applies an S-box substitution to each element of the cipher state. In hardware, the S-box implementation has a significant impact on the area consumed by the cipher. Consequently, there have been considerable research and engineering efforts to obtain compact circuit implementations of S-boxes for hardware systems. Building on past work, we present a comprehensive methodology for (1) constructing cryptographically strong affine-power S-boxes over Galois fields and (2) minimizing the VLSI technology-independent combinational logic requirements for their circuit implementations. Motivated by the potential need for larger S-boxes with improved cryptographic properties, we use this methodology to construct area minimized circuits for novel 16-bit S-boxes."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging network architecture
designed to overcome limitations of the current IP-based Internet.
One of the fundamental tenets of CCN is that content is
named and addressable. Consumers request content
by issuing interests with the desired content name. These interests
are forwarded by routers to producers, and the requested content is returned
and optionally cached at each router along the path.

In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce access control policies on sensitive content
since routers only use interest information for forwarding decisions. This motives our work
on Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) -- a scheme for access control enforcement
using only information contained in interest messages. IBAC makes sensitive content names unpredictable
to unauthorized parties. It supports both hash- and encryption-based
name obfuscation. Interest replay
attacks are addressed by formulating a mutual trust framework between producers and consumers
that enables routers to perform authorization checks before satisfying interests
from local caches. We assess computational, storage, and bandwidth costs
of each IBAC variant. Proposed design is flexible
and allows producers to arbitrarily specify and enforce any type of content access control,
without having to deal with content encryption and
key distribution. This is the first comprehensive CCN access control design
that only uses information contained in interest messages."

As a result, content becomes directly accessible and routable within the network. In this data-centric paradigm, techniques for maintaining content confidentiality and privacy typically rely on cryptographic techniques similar to those used in modern digital rights management (DRM) applications, which often require multiple consumer-to-producer (end-to-end) messages to be transmitted to establish identities, acquire licenses, and access encrypted content. In this paper, we present a secure content distribution architecture for CCN that is based on proxy re-encryption. Our design provides strong end-to-end content security and reduces the number of protocol messages required for user authentication and key retrieval. Unlike widely-deployed solutions, our solution is also capable of utilizing the opportunistic in-network caches in CCN. We also experimentally compare two proxy re-encryption schemes that can be used to implement the architecture, and describe the proof of concept application we developed over CCNx."

        abstract: "One of the pitfalls of FPGA design is the relatively long implementation time when compared to alternative architec- tures, such as CPU, GPU or DSP. This time can be greatly reduced however by using tools that can generate hardware systems in the form of a hardware description language (HDL) from high- level languages such as C, C++, or Python. Such implementations can be optimized by applying special directives that focus the high-level synthesis (HLS) effort on particular objectives, such as performance, area, throughput, or power consumption. In this paper we examine the benefits of this approach by comparing the performance and design times of HLS generated systems versus custom systems for matrix multiplication. We investigate matrix multiplication using a standard algorithm, Strassen algorithm, and a sparse algorithm to provide a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and usability of the Xilinx Vivado HLS tool. In our experience, a hardware-oriented electrical engineering student can achieve up to 61% of the performance of custom designs with 1/3 the effort, thus enabling faster hardware acceleration of many compute-bound algorithms."

        abstract: "Chaos theory is the study of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions and exhibit seemingly random behavior. From the perspective of cryp- tography and information security, randomness generated from entirely deterministic systems is a very appealing property. As such, the application of chaos in modern cryptography has been a topic of much research and debate for over a decade.
This paper presents an overview of chaotic dynamics and their role in symmetric key chaos-based cryptosystems from both a theoretical and practical perspective. It is argued that chaos-based ciphers are not likely to succeed until a valid and accepted definition of discrete chaos in finite domains is established, the inefficiencies of chaos-based cipher implementations are improved, and thorough security analysis reveals them to be comparable to standardized cryptographic primitives."

        abstract: "Keylogger programs attempt to retrieve confi- dential information by covertly capturing user input via keystroke monitoring and then relaying this information to others, often for malicious purposes. Keyloggers thus pose a major threat to business and personal activities such as Internet transactions, online banking, email, or chat. To deal with such threats, not only must users be made aware about this type of malware, but software practitioners and students must also be educated in the design, implementation, and monitoring of effective defenses against different keylogger attacks. This paper presents a case for incorporating keylog- ging in cybersecurity education. First, the paper provides an overview of keylogger programs, discusses keylogger design, implementation, and usage, and presents effective approaches to detect and prevent keylogging attacks. Second, the paper outlines several keylogging projects that can be incorporated into an undergraduate computing program to educate the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners in this important topic."

        abstract: "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an emerging networking paradigm where named and routable data (content) is the focal point. Users send explicit requests (interests) which specify content by name, and the network handles routing these interests to some entity capable of satisfying them with the appropriate data response (producer). One key feature of ICN is opportunistic in-network content caching. This property facilitates efficient content distribution by reducing bandwidth consumption, lessening network congestion, and improving the content retrieval latency by users (consumers). Unfortunately, the same feature is also detrimental to privacy of content consumers and producers. Simple to implement, and difficult to detect, timing attacks can exploit ICN routers as “oracles” and allow an adversary to learn whether a nearby consumer recently requested certain content. The attack leverages a timing side channel that relies on router caches and is implemented by requesting a few packets from each piece of content being probed. Similarly, probing attacks that target content producers can be used to discover whether certain content has been recently distributed. After analyzing the scope and feasibility of such attacks, we propose and evaluate some efficient countermeasures that offer quantifiable privacy guarantees while retaining the benefits of ICN."

        abstract: "In recent years, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has received much attention from both academic and industry participants. ICN offers data-centric inter-networking that is radically different from today’s host-based IP networks. Security and privacy features on today’s Internet were originally not present and have been incre- mentally retrofitted over the last 35 years. As such, these issues have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures towards real-world deployment. Thus, while ICN-based architectures (e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques.
This report documents the highlights and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251 on “Information-centric Networking and Security.” The goal of which was to bring together researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based archi- tectures. Upon finishing the three-day workshop, the outlook of ICN is still unclear. Many unsolved and ill-addressed problems remain, such as namespace and identity management, object se- curity and forward secrecy, and privacy. Regardless of the fate of ICN, one thing is certain: much more research and practical ex- perience with these systems is needed to make progress towards solving these arduous problems."

The span of an L(2,1) labeling f on a graph G is the maximum f(u) for all u ∈ V (G). The L(2, 1) span of a graph G is the minimum span of all L(2, 1) labelings on G. The L(2, 1) labeling on trees has been extensively studied in recent years. In this paper we present a complete characterization of the L(2, 1) span of trees up to twenty vertices."
