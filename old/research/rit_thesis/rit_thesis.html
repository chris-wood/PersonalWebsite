<h3>Thesis Log</h3>
<h5>June - July 2013</h5>
<p>
  I spent the final two months of my thesis finishing up outstanding work, running experiments, and writing the final document (see above).
</p>
<h5>May 13 - May 24</h5>
<p>
  During these two weeks I completed the following tasks:
  <ul>
    <li>Finished the Boolean function analysis software for arbitrary S-boxes</li>
    <li>Finished the Magma code to determine the algebraic complexity of a power mapping combined with a linear (or affine) transformation</li>
    <li>Wrote the Magma code to exhaustively generate all basis change matrices for degree 2 tower field representations of $GF(2^{16})$</li>
    <li>Implemented all of the linear transformation optimization hueristic approaches I found in the literature, in addition to a sequential and parallel version of the exhaustive search for the optimal solution. Each heuristic will be tested on the basis change matrices to determine the optimal number of gates required to implement each one.</li>
    <li>Wrote a great deal of the thesis!</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h5>April 29 - May 10</h5>
<p>
  During these two weeks I wrote a great deal of Boolean function analysis software for measuring the strength of S-box candidates. I continued developing the thesis chapters in parallel with my implementations, which includes the addition of a derivation for a 4th degree decomposition inverse calculation in a polynomial basis. I still need to add a derivation for the normal basis calculations. Similar to the polynomial basis, the 2nd degree decomposition is algebraically simple using a normal basis, but I am unsure of the complexity of this procedure for 4th degree decompositions. I also finished the tower field implementation of the inverse in VHDL and C using polynomial bases. The next step is to exhaustively determine the cost of such calculations, in terms of the basis transformation matrices and arithmetic, using all possible irreducible polynomials (with trace of unity) and polynomial basis. I will use Magma to find all normal bases for each 16-degree irreducible polynomial, and then repeat this experiment for those polynomials and bases. Looking into an optimal solution using mixed bases is the next step after that, time permitting. 
</p>
<h5>April 22 - April 26</h5>
<p>
  This week I finish the introductory chapter to my thesis and started running the heuristic search program. 
  I also wrote the preliminary Boolean function code for t-resilient S-boxes defined the paper:
  <ul>
    <li>Gupta, Kishan Chand, and Palash Sarkar. "Efficient representation and software implementation of resilient Maiorana-McFarland S-boxes." Information Security Applications. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2005. 317-331.</li>
  </ul>
  I also worked through the different techniques used to determine the algebraic complexity of an S-box,
  as outlined in the Progress Report #5.
</p>

<h5>April 14 - April 20</h5>
<p>
  This week I finished the VHDL implementation of the 16-bit inverse and began looking into ways to pipeline
  the design for improved throughput. I also outlined the polynomial selection heuristic and set up the 
  polyGen.py, genGen.py, and isoGen.py programs to compute all possible polynomials according to this heuristic.
</p>

<h5>April 8 - April 12</h5>
<p>
  This week I wrote the C and Python code for the inverse mapping in Galois fields with 16-bit elements. 
  The Python version was a simple extension of the Galois field library. I also started writing the composite
  field chapter of the thesis. The biggest task was finishing up the composite field transformation generation
  program so it can use both irreducible and primitive polynomials, and also splitting up the load for
  the polynomial generation program. The end goal is to run both of these on the OSG to speed up
  the performance of my exhaustive searches.
</p>
<h5>April 1 - April 5</h5>
<p>
  This week I started preparing my software for the exhaustive generation of all irreducible and primitive polynomials for my target fields. 
  I also expanded the Boolean function analysis software to include differential uniformity and nonlinear profiles (i.e. average nonlinearity
  of an S-box as the number of fixed input variables changes). I began writing the inverse and power mapping code in Python, which will be ported
  to C for performance tests in the coming week. The remainder of my time was spent performing a literature survey and writing the upcoming
  chapters in my thesis, as described in the deliverables section above. 
  <!--- look into polynomial/normal basis transformation code
  - start write software in C/C++ for s-box transformation-->
</p>
<h5>March 25 - March 29</h5>
<p>
This week I continued my work on the composite field arithmetic library for Galois fields $GF((2^n)^m)$. I also continued studying the polynomial and normal basis implementation techniques discussed in the literature. The best resources on the topic are the papers by Satoh [1] and Canright [2], cited below. With the isomorphic function generation complete this week, I can then exhaustively search over all possible S-box affine mappings on 16 bit elements, identify the strongest candidates using my Boolean function analysis tools, and then implement these in hardware using various tower field decompositions with polynomial bases. Normal bases will not be investigated until the polynomial bases are complete.

</p>

<p>
My major tasks for this week orthogonal to the deliverables include:
<ul>
  <li>Finish the CFA slides for my progress update and crpyto 2 class lecture.</li>
  <li>Thesis section on polynomial basis.</li>
  <li>Isomorphic matrix mapping.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>March 18 - March 22</h5>
<p>
Continued working on isomorphic function generation - still a major block in my work. Need to review my number theory notes and get back on track. I also started writing the Thesis chapter that discusses the composite-field representation of the AES S-box using my working HDL design. I need to start finalizing the software implementations of all of the candidate S-box designs (based off of finite fields for computability) - affine transformations with a multiplicative inverse in $GF(2^n)$ are not the only suitable choices. Boolean function designs do not have "computable" representations - they require LUTs, which makes them suitable for hardware designs only. My major tasks for this week orthogonal to the deliverables include:
<ul>
  <li>Select candidate "computable" S-box designs (are there any besides Nyberg's original three?)</li>
  <li>Start studying the Boolean function construction techniques and try to sketch out some pseudocode for implementing them - i.e. generating a truth table and ANF representation for Sage processing.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Met with Staszek and Marcin for lunch to discuss my goals for the fall 
quarter. At a high-level, they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finish the design and development of BAIT (or integrate it into an 
  existing package like <em>boolfun </em>for <strong>R</strong>).</li>
  <li>Implement a VHDL testbed that will aid testing and characterization of 
  Boolean function implementations (i.e. to help gather hardware metrics).</li>
  <li>Identify cryptographic measurements of interest that will be used in 
  this study.</li>
  <li>Gather data from the literature about classes of Boolean functions and 
  their values for the aforementioned measurements.</li>
  <li>Finish the thesis proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to discussing these goals, we also established the milestone of 
finishing my full thesis proposal before the end of the quarter. If all goes 
well, I hope to have this done by the end of week 6. </p>
